Program Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Remember Me" is an address book program that allows you to enter people's names and their information, 
such as their Phone Numbers, emails, Home Addresses, and Birthday dates.

The address book starts out blank, and any information that is added to the address book will be stored
in text files even after the program is exited. The program allows the user to search for entries by name
and edit or delete entries easily. When searching for entries, names will automatically be sorted 
alphabetically.
